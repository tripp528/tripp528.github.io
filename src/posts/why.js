        <h1>Why does this blog exist?</h1>
        <p>
            To give back to the wisdom I have garnered throughout my years from those who choose to put themselves on the internet. I would be a shell of the person I am today if I had not had access to the internet since a young age. The number of mentors that I have grown to love on the internet far outweigh those in real life. I hope to provide value to my fellow humans who seek insight about this (at any given time) stage of my journey.

            To compile a portfolio of my existence. Throughout my life, I have pursued many avenues of being a human. Although I carry much forward from each, I am left feeling that there is immense value left in the void. This is an attempt to capture some of that. To give it a place to live on, to thrive, to be discovered and built upon.

            To aid in my own journey of learning and development. The precise articulation and organization of ideas that comes along with writing them down is invaluable. Combine that with the accountability knowing that others might actually read what I write, the perfect storm is born to explore life much more rigorously. Related, I hope to hone the skill of articulation and mental organization throughout this process.

            What to expect? I really don’t know yet. Topics may span far and wide, from technology, to music, relationships, philosophy, mental and physical well being, to adventure. My aim is to keep the content relevant to what I am most vigorously exploring in real time. Right now, that happens to be becoming a more public facing human. Getting on the playing field. Interacting instead of acting in a vacuum. Being a participant in this crazy paradigm that humans have evolved.

            I realize that it’s a bit meta to make a first post about why I want to make a first post, but when it comes down to it, that’s what feels most authentic. Authenticity is the measure of success I care about.
